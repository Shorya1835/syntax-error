# Syntax Error Project

### Project Description

The project uses python's computer vision (**opencv**) library to detect the movement of green line and green dot. Using these controls the game can be played. In the game a motorbike ie. enemy chases the car ie. us and we can shoot bullets on the enemy.

### Requirements

The modules needed for this project can be downloaded using
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to clone the git repository use,
```
git clone https://github.com/ShreeSinghi/syntax-error.git
```
After cloning the repository, run the `game.py` file

### Modules

 - opencv (for image detection)
 - pygame (for building the game)
 - multiprocessing (for running parallel processes)

### Working

The user wears specially coloured gloves which act as controllers for the game.
The green line (in right hand) is used to control speed of the car and the green dot (in left hand) shoots bullets on enemy when the dot has been covered.
